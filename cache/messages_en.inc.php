<p>Train your team regularly in order to improve stamina, technique and freshness of your players.</p>

<p>How you train your team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a trainer and hire him for a number of training units.</li>
<li>If you have hired a trainer, you can determine the intensity and training focus.</li>
<li>Click on button \"Execute training\". The players will be trained immediately under the supervision of the trainer, considering your preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot execute trainings during a match.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a trainer</strong></p>

<p>The figures for \"Effectivity\" indicate how successful the trainer can train your team. 50% means, for instance, that players will be improved during a training session by a chance of 50%.</p>

<p>Note that the trainer\'s fee will be debitted immediately after you have hired him.</p>

<p><strong>Execute training</strong></p>

<p>If you execute a training session, the players\' strengths will be improved according to the trainer\'s effectivity and configured intensitiy. The higher the intensity is, the more freshness your players will loose, but the higher is the chance of improvements.</p>

<p>Injured players cannot train, but regenerate during training sessions.</p>

<li>Popularity with fans. It depends on your current success.</li>

<p><strong>Extend contracts</strong></p>

<p>Players whose contract is about to end and can be extended, will be marked red and with a danger sign in the overview. It also appears a button \"Extend Contract\". On click on this button you will be forwarded to a contract extension negotiation page.</p>

<p>The captain can improve the team morale when your team is in deficit during a match. The more experience a player has, the more respekt he gets from other players.</p>
